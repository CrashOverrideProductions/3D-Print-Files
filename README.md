One Last Note: I intent to be meticulous in using community generated documents and schematics where i cant easily reverse engineer things myself, under no circumstances will any Official/Leaked Nintendo Interlectual Property be used in this project (e.g. Actual Nintendo Schematics are covered by Copyright, however the circuit is not and therefore can be published if a third party person draws and publishes thier own reverse engineered schematic)
